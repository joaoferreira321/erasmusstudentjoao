This task consists of me watching a tutorial on how to create an Aim Trainer in Unreal Engine.
It was challenging because I had never used the program before, but I was curious to learn how it works because it is very comprehensive.
I encountered some difficulties because the tutorial I had to use as a reference was based on a previous version of the program. As a result, there were some parts that I couldn't recreate, such as the target, weapon mechanics, and the environment. Since I couldn't use the same environment, I had to make decisions about what would make sense or not in the map, and as a result, I didn't include the button even though I watched the entire tutorial and learned how to create it.
Overall, I enjoyed doing this task because now I have some knowledge about the program that I can further explore in my college in Portugal. By completing this mini-project, I know what to expect when working on more complex projects, and I have a basic understanding of how to program certain parts of a game. In the future, instead of creating a target and a target spawner for an aim trainer, I can use this knowledge to create an enemy and an enemy spawn.
